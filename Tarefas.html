            My sketch is more of a departure, and takes it firmly into Antiqua territory. I
            added quite a bit of contrast (and should probably tone it back down, at least
            in the Normal) and the serifs are bracketed. I also widened the overall
            proportion a bit, so the rounds fit in better with the visually wider seriffed
            characters. I tried to keep as many of the salient features intact as I could,
            but it’s a definite departure from Meta. That may not be a bad thing, though,
            because I do think they look good together, and a real Antiqua would probably
            have a longer shelf life. Besides the contrast, I haven’t settled on a shape for
            the ball terminals yet – see what you think of the various options.

            The slab is closer to what you and I had dicussed in the past, but my grand plan
            (and the underlying reason why I think Meta Serif should be an Antiqua) is to
            draw Unit Serif as well, and let that one be a real Egyptian. Its forms are
            simpler and stiffer anyway, and we’ve already got the serif weight and shape
            figured out on I, i and j. In the end, I think we’d end up with a serif and slab
            that could be used together, and they’d be compatible with both FF Meta and FF
            Unit.
