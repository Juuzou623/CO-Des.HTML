        My sketch is more of a departure, and takes it firmly into Antiqua territory. I
        added quite a bit of contrast (and should probably tone it back down, at least
        in the Normal) and the serifs are bracketed. I also widened the overall
        proportion a bit, so the rounds fit in better with the visually wider seriffed
        characters. I tried to keep as many of the salient features intact as I could,
        but it’s a definite departure from Meta. That may not be a bad thing, though,
        because I do think they look good together, and a real Antiqua would probably
        have a longer shelf life. Besides the contrast, I haven’t settled on a shape for
        the ball terminals yet – see what you think of the various options.

        The slab is closer to what you and I had dicussed in the past, but my grand plan
        (and the underlying reason why I think Meta Serif should be an Antiqua) is to
        draw Unit Serif as well, and let that one be a real Egyptian. Its forms are
        simpler and stiffer anyway, and we’ve already got the serif weight and shape
        figured out on I, i and j. In the end, I think we’d end up with a serif and slab
        that could be used together, and they’d be compatible with both FF Meta and FF
        Unit.
